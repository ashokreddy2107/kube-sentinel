## 2024-05-23 - Avoid Eager Computation in Large Lists
**Learning:** Found an anti-pattern in `PodTable` where `podStatusCache` was eagerly computing status for ALL pods in the list using `useMemo`. This is O(N) where N is the total number of pods. Since `SimpleTable` handles pagination (rendering only ~20 items), we should compute derived data like pod status lazily in the render cycle (or column accessor).
**Action:** When using paginated tables, avoid eagerly computing derived data for the entire dataset. Rely on memoization at the item level (like `getPodStatus` using `WeakMap`) and let the render cycle trigger computation only for visible items (O(PageSize)).
